# Co-Driver Splitter

**DISCLAIMER: I STRONGLY ADVISE NOT TO PLAY ONLINE WITH THIS PLUGIN. WHILE I HAVE NOT VERIFIED IT, IT'S MORE THAN LIKELY TO TRIGGER A VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) BAN!** \
**You have been warned!**

Ever wanted to have Co-driver calls play through headphones while the other sounds play through speakers? Now you are able to without hacking around a convoluted speaker setup!

Co-Driver Splitter is a plugin for recent DiRT, GRID and F1 games splitting audio between multiple devices. Now Co-driver, Spotter and Commentator calls will be played through a Communications device, while everything else plays over speakers!

Previously people hacked such setups around by faking a 5.1 speaker set and plugging in headphones to a center speaker jack. With the plugin, all you need to do is set a correct Communications device!
